# LORA-LONG-RANGE-SENSOR
Report PBL3

In the project, we will construct a monitoring, controlling, and data logging system. This system will be monitored through sensors such as "humidity" and "temperature" to transmit data between the sender and receiver via LoRa transceivers. The LoRa receiver will display the metrics on a Web Server, on an OLED screen, and log data onto an SD card. Electronic components will be controlled through LoRa transmission, executing commands on the LoRa receiver side and transmitting the executed commands through the LoRa transmitter side.
